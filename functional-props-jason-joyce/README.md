User Stories
As a user, I can see an application that has a list of food items and the price of each item.
Create an object named foodList, setFoodList  with key value pairs - food: "Pizza", price: "$1.99"
* We need to import useState into our parent component *

Hint: Take some time to think about the data structure that will allow you to effectively store the required information.
Create a child component named foodList.js
Use a high order function .map() to iterate over the array of objects, which lives on the App.js component. 
Make our application more dynamic, we will use our useState function and pass Props to the component

As a user, I can click a button to select an item I wish to order.
As a user, I can see the items I have selected to order displayed on the page.
